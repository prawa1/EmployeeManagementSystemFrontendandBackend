#### 2. salary-department.spec.ts
**Location:** `src/app/components/salary/salary-department.spec.ts`

**Purpose:** Department-specific testing for the Salary component.

**Test Scenarios:**
- Department name handling methods
- PDF generation with department information
- Integration tests for department enhancement

### Frontend Tests
```bash
ng test --include="**/department-integration.spec.ts"
ng test --include="**/salary-department.spec.ts"
```

## Success Criteria

All integration tests validate:
1. ✅ Department names display correctly in both profile and payslip
2. ✅ Department names are consistent across all components
3. ✅ PDF generation includes correct department information
4. ✅ Proper error handling for missing department data
5. ✅ API endpoints return correct department information
6. ✅ Fallback handling shows "Department Not Assigned" instead of "N/A"
